                    <p class="intro-para">Born into a middle-class family and being a First-Gen student, I've always valued education and the opportunities it can provide. 
                        Thanks to the hard work and intelligence of my parents, our family's socio-economic situation improved over time, 
                        and I was able to access opportunities to become an educated professional. I helped my family by being studious and 
                        obtaining scholarships. When I received my first scholarship, I felt like a true, self-sufficient adult. Fast forward, 
                        my dedication to studies limited my exposure to worldly knowledge. Then, one day, I realized I was learning about the world. 
                        Along the way, I met many smart, talented, confident, rich, and influential people. Man, I even had the opportunity to meet 
                        someone who was attending Harvard. The world suddenly seemed smaller, and I believed that anything was possible.
                        However, reality soon brought me back to Earth. It was not as easy as it seemed. 
                        Eventually, I learned more about myself, my strengths, weaknesses, and the career I wanted to pursue, among other things. As a result, 
                        I gained confidence and became less fearful. I realized that most challenges could be overcome with time and effort. That's my story. 
                        I'm still learning, and I hope to grow in my career with your company. Please look at my LinkedIn profile to learn more about my technical capabilities. 
                        I am more than happy to share my resume if there is an opportunity. </p>
